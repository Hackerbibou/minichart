This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Tools Used

Next.js
Django
Typescript
Javascript
Python
TailwindCss
Recharts.js
Apexchartsjs
Vercel
Github
Git
Virtual Studio Code

## Approach

My approach was simple. As stated on the submission requirements, I used Rechart to display data from a backend server for 3/4 of the charts, and used Apexcharts for candlestick charts since recharts didn't have candlesticks. I deployed both the Django app and Nextjs on Vercel, then used cors and axios to connect them. Finally, I used Git and Github to manage the codebase
